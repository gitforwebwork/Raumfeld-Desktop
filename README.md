Raumfeld-Desktop
================

Python Desktop Controller for Teufel Raumfeld

This program aims to bring basic Raumfeld controls (next / previous, start / pause, volume) to the desktop.
As the software is written in python, it will run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

I am currently working on the software, it is not yet functional but I'm getting there.
